<h2>My guitar experience</h2>

<p>I have only played guitar for about 7 or 8 months but I have really loved it and have practiced many hours and had lessons for a little bit, I stopped lessons once I felt like I could teach myself faster than learning from a teacher once a month.</p>

<p>I have learned many songs on guitar, I have also learned a lot about music theory. One big insperation of mine is John Mayor, he went to a music school but dropped out because he relised he could learn more on his own than at Berkly. This made me want to teach myself theory and learn for myself how music works.

<p>I first wanted to learn guitar because of my brother-in-law Tyler plays,I asked him to teach me what he knows and that started the first spark in me. What has kept me going is that my other brother-in-law Hunter plays guitar also, he likes a lot of the same songs as me, so now we play electric guitar together and learn many songs together.</p>
